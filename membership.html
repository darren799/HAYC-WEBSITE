    <h2>More Than a Membership — A Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>
      Holly Acres Yacht Club is about more than simply keeping a boat at a marina.
      It’s about being part of a community that values friendship, shared
      experiences, and a relaxed approach to life on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members enjoy meaningful connections that extend beyond the dock —
      whether it’s meeting up for dockside conversations, joining group cruises,
      or taking part in social events designed to bring people together.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a place where boaters feel welcome, supported, and encouraged
      to enjoy their time on the Occoquan River in a way that feels personal,
      social, and rewarding.
